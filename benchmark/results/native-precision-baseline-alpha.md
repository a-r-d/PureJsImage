# Benchmark result

Created: 2026-08-30T01:17:51.110Z

Profile: `competitors`

Environment: Linux 6.17.0-41-generic, x64, Node v24.16.0, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10700 CPU @ 2.90GHz, 16 logical CPUs

## Engine versions

| Engine | Version | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| purejsimage | 0.17.0 (workspace) | pure-javascript |

Resize workflows use each engine’s public default kernel. PureJsImage and Sharp use Lanczos 3; Jimp uses bilinear. Cross-kernel timings are default-experience comparisons, not matched-quality comparisons.

## Compatibility

| Engine | Workflow | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| purejsimage | png-alpha-resize | pass | - |

## Performance on workflows supported by every selected engine

| Engine | Workflow | Median wall | p95 wall | Median CPU | Peak RSS | Peak RSS delta | External | ArrayBuffer | Source read | Max decoded block | Quality | Output |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| purejsimage | png-alpha-resize | 66.9 ms | 72.7 ms | 91.6 ms | 142.8 MiB | 3.1 MiB | 23.4 MiB | 13.8 MiB | - MiB | - MiB | 48.39 dB | 0.0 MiB |

## Startup and npm package size

| Engine | Import | RSS after import | First JPEG metadata | First JPEG resize | npm package (unpacked) | Production packages |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| purejsimage | 84.0 ms | 110.5 MiB | 1.6 ms (pass) | 520.7 ms (pass) | 6.4 MiB | 1 |

The `npm package (unpacked)` value is the byte size after npm extracts what it publishes, not the compressed `.tgz` download size. It includes every package required by an engine and the production dependencies present for this platform, including jSquash codec/resize packages and Sharp platform packages. Exact package lists are recorded in JSON; run `npm pack --dry-run --json` for tarball size.

A timing only counts when output validation passes. Input file reads, worker startup, warmups, output validation, and quality measurement are outside warm workflow timings. Startup measurements use a separate fresh process for each engine.

Quality is premultiplied-RGBA PSNR against an independently decoded exact-area reference. `exact` means every compared channel matched. Resize timings use the engine-default kernels identified above, so cross-kernel rows are default-experience rather than matched-quality comparisons. Lossy encoder quality scales are not calibrated; the quality column makes that difference visible but does not by itself turn equal API quality settings into a matched-quality size study.
